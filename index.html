<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="time-series-data-and-path-plot">Time Series data and path plot</h2>
<p>The ggplot2 package comes with the <strong>economics</strong> dataset. For this assignment we will consider the following columns:</p>
<ul>
<li>pop -&gt; population (in thousands)</li>
<li>date</li>
<li>uempmed -&gt; median unemployed duration in weeks</li>
<li>unemploy -&gt; number of people unemployed (in thousands)</li>
</ul>
<p>Analysis steps:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Use the <code>str</code> function to examine the economics dataset</p></li>
<li><p>We would like to examine the relation between unemployment rate (unemploy/pop) (on the x axis) and uempmed (on the y axis), and it’s evolution over time</p></li>
<li><p>In the ggplot() function call fill in appropriate values for ‘?’ symbols.</p></li>
<li><p>Add a path plot to join points adjacent in time. (code provided)</p></li>
<li><p>Add a scatter plot layer to display the relation between unemployment rate and uempmed. (partial code provided - fill in the value for ‘?’)</p></li>
<li><p>In the scatter plot layer color the points by year to make it easier to see the direction in time. Use function year defined below. In the call to the <code>year</code> function fill replace ‘?’ with the appropriate argument.</p></li>
<li><p>Explain how the relationship between unemployment rate and median number of weeks unemployed has evolved over the years.</p></li>
<li><p>Use ggplotly to make the plot interactive and easier to interpret.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, deploy the rendered html file as a web page using your enterprise GitHub account</p></li>
